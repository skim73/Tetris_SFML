# Tetris_SFML
Creating the classic version of Tetris game with SFML 2.5.1 in C++
- The window application is 1600x900.

# How to play
- Go to "release" tab at the top (between "packages" and "contributers" tabs) and click on "Tetris_SFML v0.?-beta" zip folder; click on Tetris_SFML.exe to run
- Left/Right Keys : move Tetromino left/right
- Down Key: accelerate Tetromino down
- Z: rotate counterclockwise
- X: rotate clockwise
- Enter: confirm (on menus)
- ESC: pause (in game), get out of High Scores screen

- BTW, the terminal is the small black window looking like command prompt that appears along with the game.
*** At the end of the game, whenever the game freezes on a black screen with the yellow message regarding the instructions on this terminal thing, DO NOT ASSUME THE GAME IS NOT RESPONDING AND FORCIBLY CLOSE IT! THE PROGRAM IS WAITING FOR YOUR INPUT AT THE TERMINAL WINDOW!
